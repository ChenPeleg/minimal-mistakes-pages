## Usage

The best way to use it is to goto you project folder, and run: 

```console
$ npx hours-report
``` 

the console will output the location of a csv file that contains the report base on your git log. 

## Supports



The package is written in vanilla JS so no dependencies (only Typescript as dev dependency). 
This is so it can support version 12-18 of nodeJS.
